This can be shown as a table, unordered list, or a "tree" diagram in a generic code block. For a tree diagram, I found ChatGPT to do the best job. I only found 10 repos with a "decent" project structure section.

**Alternate titles**:

**Tools to generate a code block tree diagram**:

- [tree.nathanfriend.com](https://tree.nathanfriend.com/)
- [ASCII Tree Generator](https://ascii-tree-generator.com/)

## Contributing

> OPTIONAL: _Notes about allowing contributors to help develop your project with a link to a file named `contributing.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`._

## License

> OPTIONAL: _A brief note on the license for your project with a link to the license._

Adding a license is easy if you follow the steps in the GitHub Docs article [Adding a license to a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository). I added an MIT license from my GitHub repo and then used `git pull` to pull it into my local repo.

In the Code:You repos I viewed, I found 16 repos with a license, mostly MIT but 5 with GPL and then 2 oddball ones (Apache, BDO).

## Miscellaneous optional headings:

Depending on your project, some of these items may be useful as headings/sections:

- Additional Notes
- Disclaimer or Legal disclaimer
- Bugs and Issues or Reporting issues
- Help & Support
- Notes or Important Notes or General info
- Project Details
- Live Demo - I found 4 with a link to a live demo of their project
- Abstract
- Problem Statement
- Data Sources
- Lighthouse Report
- Unit Tests
- Wireframes
- Other Resources
- Summary or Wrapping Up

I found 1 repo with

- a Code of Conduct markdown file,
- one using GitHub Devicons,
- and none that used shields.io badges.

## Devicons

Devicons: check out the [devicons repo](https://github.com/devicons/devicon/tree/master/icons). You are going to have to decide which link to get, it's a little tricky, and you may need to download an SVG, change it's color in a program like Inkscape or Illustrator, then upload that svg into your repo and link to it that way.

## Shields.io badges

Shields.io: Check out the [Shield.io website](https://shields.io/), click

- Get Started,
- Search for a category in the left sidebar,
- Then in the right sidebar enter the variables like your GitHub username, repo name, make choices for the other others,
- Then choose URL or Markdown for the eventual link/href you need.
- You can also choose the badge style - I like flat, flat-square, or for-the-badge, but there are other options.

Also check out this markdown file on all the [shields.io badges](https://github.com/Kernix13/markdown-cheatsheet/blob/master/shields.md) which has all the categories and notes for the ones that would be good for a beginner.
