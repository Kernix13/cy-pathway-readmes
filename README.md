# README Templates for Code:You Pathways

I looked at 200+ capstone projects and found ~82 repos with good project READMEs. I searched for:

- CodeLouisville and Code:Louisville
- CodeKentucky and Code:Kentucky
- CodeKY and Code:KY
- CodeYou and Code:You

... and I appended either "capstone" or "project" to those.

There are headings in common to all pathways, but each pathway has their own unique headings. The pathways covered in this repo:
