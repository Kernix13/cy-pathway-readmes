# README Headings for the C# Pathway

> See [web-dev.md](./web-dev.md) for headings common to all pathways

## Miscellaneous optional headings:

I did not find many C# capstone projects that had a "good" README. Here is a list of headings that you may find useful:

- Object Schema
- APIs Used
- File Descriptions
- General requirements and guidelines
- Manual Test Execution
- Notes
- System Requirements and Recommendations
- Test Plan
- Unit Test Creation
- Summary or Wrapping Up
- SQL Server Version
- How to Use the Web App
- Building this project

See _Miscellaneous optional headings_ for other potentional headings in [web-dev.md](./web-dev.md) and [data-analysis.md](./data-analysis.md)

Also see the bottom of [web-dev.md](./web-dev.md) for notes on using [GitHub Devicons](https://github.com/devicons/devicon/tree/master/icons) and [Shields.io badges](https://shields.io/).
