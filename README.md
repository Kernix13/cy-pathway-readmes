# README Templates for Code:You Pathways

I looked at 200+ capstone projects and found ~80 repos with good project READMEs. I searched for:

- CodeLouisville and Code:Louisville
- CodeKentucky and Code:Kentucky
- CodeKY and Code:KY
- CodeYou and Code:You

... and I appended either "capstone" or "project" to those.

There are headings in common to all pathways, but each pathway has their own unique headings. The pathways covered in this repo:

1. [Web Development](./web-dev.md) - 28 repos found
2. [Data Analysis](./data-analysis.md) - 40 repos found
   - 6 repos found for Python
   - 28 repos found for Jupyter Notebook
   - 3 repos found for Python & Jupyter Notebook
   - 3 repos found for Python, Jupyter Notebook + Cython, C, C++, JS, TS, CSS, Shell
3. [C#](./c-sharp.md) - 9 repos found
   - 8 repos found for C#
   - 1 repo found with C# + JS + HTML + CSS
4. [Google IT Support](./it-support.md) - no repos found with anything other than a single paragraph
5. Other/Unknown:
   - 1 repo using Shell
   - 1 repo using Objective-C, Objective-C++, Ruby but with 4 contributors
   - 1 repo with TypeScript & JavaScript, no HTML
   - 1 repo with CSS only
   - 1 repo with Java

These are the only pathways that I know of at this time.

> **NOTE**: I have more "alternate" headings in the Web Dev file.
