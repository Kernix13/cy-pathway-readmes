Adding a license is easy if you follow the steps in the GitHub Docs article [Adding a license to a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository). I added mine from the GitHub site and then used `git pull` to pull it into my local repo.

## Miscellaneous optional headings:

I did not find many C# capstone projects that had a "good" README. Here is a list of headings that you may find useful:

- Object Schema
- APIs Used
- File Descriptions
- General requirements and guidelines
- Manual Test Execution
- Notes
- System Requirements and Recommendations
- Test Plan
- Unit Test Creation
- Summary or Wrapping Up
