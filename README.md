# README Templates for Code:You Pathways

I looked at 200+ capstone projects and found ~80 repos with good project READMEs. I searched for:

- CodeLouisville
- Code:Louisville
- CodeKentucky
- Code:Kentucky
- CodeKY
- Code:KY
- CodeYou
- Code:You

... and I appended either "capstone" or "project" to those.

There are headings in common to all pathways, but each pathway has their own unique headings. The pathways covered in this repo:

1. [Web Development](./web-dev.md)
2. [Data Analysis](./data-analysis.md)
3. [C#](./c-sharp.md)
4. [Google IT Support](./it-support.md)

These are the only pathways that I know of at this time.
