Adding a license is easy if you follow the steps in the GitHub Docs article [Adding a license to a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository). I added mine from the GitHub site and then used `git pull` to pull it into my local repo.
